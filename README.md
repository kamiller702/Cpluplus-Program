# Cpluplus-Program
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  In short, this project takes a .txt file and leveraging maps in C++ will give the user multiple ways of visualizing it. They can view it in the terminal with        numbers or use the histogram function. The program automatically creates a new file that displays produce and assaociated amount that was sold per .txt file given.

# What did you do particularly well?
  I started off this project with the intention of using vectors. I am happy that it was recomened to use maps which i learned were much like dictionaries in python, which made the program much easier to write.
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  If we were able to add more data to the .txt file we recieved (i.e. time stamp) we could track if we sell more produce at a certain time of day. Or even what day we sell the most produce on so we have the correct amount of produce on display. We could also add another function to display a graph of how much produce we sell throught the day.
  
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I had to learn maps for c++. I remember learning dictionaries in Python but i didnt know there was an equivalent in C++. Using the class materrials provided i was able to learn this knew concept and i think i implemented it very well. It turned out way better than my original thought of using vectors. 
  
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I loved how maps automaticaly put the output in alphabetical order. It came with easy fucnctions like count that made counting all the produce sold very convient.
 I also learned that there is a un-alphabetical order option as well if i ever needed that. 
 
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  By creating the grocery class first i was then able to make functions that i needed in order for the menu to work. Im learning to start my code by making a class and then thinking about all the different functions im going to need. Then i just go function by function for all the process that i need to complete. In this case i knew they wanted a menu with four options so i just made a function for each. In summary, everything is contained within its respective function. In the event that they wanted to add/change/remove one of the options they would just need to update the respective functions code. I put notes and descriptions throughout the code to make it more readable, and its addaptable because a future programer could add more options to the menu like prieviously stated and all they would have to do is add a new function and update the class or extend it to include a deli or meat class with its own respective functions.
